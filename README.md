## How to Run

To run the program, simply type 

```cmd
python src/main.py
```

in your command prompt. 

Your dataset should be placed in the data folder first. When you run the program, there will be some menu along the way. You should answer it accordingly. 

If you want to check whether the program runs or not individually, I have provided you with some codes in the sources. At the bottom of the code, you will see some commented examples of usages.
